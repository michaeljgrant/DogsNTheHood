## About This Application
- - - -
:dog: Dogs 'N' The Hood :dog:

The goal of this application is to bring together dog loves and owners in an area who are seeking to socialise their dogs with similar breeds. 

The concept of this application is to utilise the google maps API and fetch parks near to the user (if they exist) and then cross-reference local council registered pet data to approximate breeds that may appear within the area searched.

The MVP for this application will be a park finder for dog lovers - that will allow owners to comment on park locations and add their own photos and breed names.
